# Mwalimu AI
Mwalimu AI, an AI-powered educational platform specifically designed for rural African schools, will provide personalized learning paths, AI-powered tutoring, automated grading and progress tracking, offline functionality, and localizedÂ content.

## Structure
This repository is structured as follows
- `backend/` - This directory contains the backend code for Mwalimu AI, including API endpoints, database models and migrations, model architectures, and business logic implemented in Python with FastAPI and Tensorflow/Keras respectively
- `frontend/` - This directory contains the front-end code for the user interface of Mwalimu AI, implemented in Typescript and Javascript using NextJS, Zustand, and MUI.
- `models/` - This directory contains the trained RNN and GPT models used by Mwalimu to create personalized learning paths and to facilitate automatic grading. These models are implemented using the Python-based AI/ML library, Tensorflow and Keras.

## Purpose  
The purpose of this repository is to develop and maintain an advanced educational platform tailored for rural African schools. The platform leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to address educational challenges specific to these regions, including limited access to quality teaching resources, the need for personalized education, and the difficulty of tracking and evaluating student progress. By making this repository public, we aim to engage the open-source community to make suggestions, raise issues, and overall contribute to the development of Mwalimu AI.

## How Neural Networks support Mwalimu AI.
Mwalimu AI uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze individual student performance and learning behaviors. This analysis allows the platform to generate personalized learning paths, ensuring that each student receives instruction and exercises tailored to their unique needs and learning pace. Other key features include:
- AI-Powered Tutoring
- Automated grading and progress tracking
- Localized content
